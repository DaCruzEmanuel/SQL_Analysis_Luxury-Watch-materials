# Luxury watch materials SQL Analysis Project

This project demonstrates my proficiency with SQL, showcasing some of the most common SQL statements used in data analysis. I used a fictitious dataset gathered from Kaggle, focusing on luxury watches. The purpose of this project is to explore the dataset through a series of analytical questions, providing insights into the data.

## Project Overview

- **Dataset:** A fictitious dataset of luxury watches obtained from Kaggle.
- **Tools Used:** SQL Server for data storage, query execution, and analysis.
- **Objective:** To perform data exploration and answer specific analytical questions using SQL queries.

## Tasks Performed

1. **Problem Definition:** Identified 15 key questions and analytical tasks to perform on the dataset.
2. **Dataset Import:** Imported the luxury watches dataset into SQL Server.
3. **Data Exploration:** Conducted data exploration by answering predefined questions through SQL queries.

## SQL Statements Used

In this project, the following key SQL statements and operations were utilized:

- **SELECT:** To retrieve data from the database.
- **DISTINCT:** To filter out duplicate values.
- **COUNT:** To count the number of records or distinct values.
- **GROUP BY:** To aggregate data by specific columns.
- **ORDER BY:** To sort the results based on specified criteria.
- **AVG:** To calculate the average of numeric values.
- **MAX:** To find the maximum value in a set.
- **CONCAT:** To concatenate multiple values into a single string.
- **ROW_NUMBER:** To assign a unique sequential integer to rows within a partition.
- **CASE:** To create conditional logic within queries.
- **WITH (CTE):** To define a Common Table Expression for easier query structuring.
